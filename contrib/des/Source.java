        you may find sim.util.distribution.Scale to be a useful utility class here).
        
        <p>The modeler can also change the AMOUNT which is produced by setting either a deterministic
        PRODUCTION (via setProduction()) or by setting a distribution to determine the production (via

        <ul>
        	<li>If we are at the Schedule.EPOCH, we produce nothing and return immediately.
        	<li>If we are scheduled to produce something at a future time, and have not reached it yet,
        	again, we produce nothing and return immediately.
        	<li>Else we'll produce something.
        </ul>
        
        <li>If we've gotten this far, we next compute the next time we should produce something.
        <ul>
        	<li>If we are at the Schedule.EPOCH, and we are producing at a deterministic rate, then
        		the next time is just the previous determined time plus either the rate or (if we are using a
        		random offset) the rate time a random number between 0 and 1.
        	<li>If we are NOT at the Schedule.EPOCH, and we are producing at a deterministic rate, then
        		the next time is just the previous determined time plus either the rate.
        	<li>If we are producing at a rate determined by a distribution, then the next time is 
        		the previous determined time plus a random value under this distribution.
        </ul>
        
        If we reschedule by rate, then we next reschedule ourselves at the next time and ordering.

        <li>Now we determine how much to produce.
        <ul>
        	<li>If we are producing a deterministic production amount, then we use the production amount.
        	<li>If we are producing an amount determined by a distribution, then we select a random value 
        	under this distribution.
        </ul>
                    
        <p>New entities are produced by calling the method buildEntity().
                
        Total production cannot exceed the stated capacity.
