/**
   A non-blocking provider of resources.  A provider can be attached
   to any number of Receivers.  If a provider can make offers, it will
   do so to all the receivers, either in the order in which they were
   registered with the Provider, or in random shuffled order. 
   Providers also have a TYPICAL resource, 
   which exists only to provide a resource type.  Providers also have
   a RESOURCE, initially zero, of the same type, which is used as a 
   pool for resources.  The Provider class does not use the resource
   variable, and only makes it available as a convenience for subclasses
   to use as they see fit.
